## IDENTIFIED GAPS & ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### HIGH PRIORITY - Must Fix

#### 1. **FAQ Section Expansion (8 → 25 questions)**
Current: 8 questions
Target: 25 questions with schema markup

**Add these question types:**
- Pricing questions (cost, payment, estimates)
- Process questions (how long, what to expect)
- Location questions (service areas, mobile vs studio)
- Cat-specific questions (breeds, temperament, health)
- Credential questions (CFMG, training, experience)

**Suggested new FAQs:**
1. How much does cat grooming cost in Toronto?
2. How much does a lion cut cost for a cat?
3. Do you groom aggressive or anxious cats?
4. How long does a cat grooming appointment take?
5. What is a CFMG certified groomer?
6. Do you offer mobile cat grooming in Windsor?
7. Can you groom Persian cats?
8. What should I do to prepare my cat for grooming?
9. How often should I get my cat groomed?
10. Do you offer cat nail trimming only appointments?
11. What areas in Toronto do you serve?
12. Is cat grooming stressful for my cat?
13. What is included in a standard cat groom?
14. Do you groom senior cats?
15. What is the difference between a lion cut and teddy bear cut?
16. Do you use sedation for cat grooming?
17. Can I stay during my cat's grooming appointment?

#### 2. **Content Expansion (800 → 1500+ words)**

Add CTAs at:
- After services section

- After FAQ section
- In locations section
- Sticky mobile CTA

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. **H2 Keyword Optimization**
Current H2s:
- "Our Grooming Services" → Change to: "Cat Grooming Services in Toronto & Windsor"

- "Grooming Gallery" → Change to: "Cat Grooming Results Gallery"

#### 5. **Internal Linking Enhancement**
Add links:
- Services section → Link to resource pages
- FAQ answers → Link to specific services
- Location sections → Cross-link between Toronto/Windsor content
- Footer → Add links to all pages

#### 6. **llms.txt Expansion**
Current: ~75 lines, basic
Target: 150+ lines with all keywords

Add:
- All 50 keywords
- Full FAQ section
- Neighborhood-level service areas
- Competitive advantages

### LOWER PRIORITY

#### 7. **Create Dedicated Service Pages**
- `/lion-cut-toronto.html` - Target: "lion cut cat Toronto"
- `/mobile-cat-grooming.html` - Target: "mobile cat grooming Toronto"
- `/cat-nail-trim-toronto.html` - Target: "cat nail trim Toronto"

#### 8. **Create Location-Specific Pages**
- `/cat-grooming-east-york.html`
- `/cat-grooming-scarborough.html`
- `/cat-grooming-north-york.html`
