                    <h2>Certified Feline Master Groomer</h2>
                    <p>As a <strong>Certified Feline Master Groomer (CFMG)</strong>, I specialize exclusively in cats. This certification represents the highest level of achievement in feline grooming, awarded by the National Cat Groomers Institute of America after rigorous training, written exams, and practical assessments. Your cat receives expert care from someone who truly understands feline behavior, anatomy, and the specific grooming techniques that keep cats safe and comfortable.</p>
                    <p>I offer both <strong>mobile cat grooming house calls</strong> and <strong>in-studio appointments</strong> in Toronto (East York) and Windsor, Ontario, giving you the flexibility to choose what works best for you and your cat. Many cats feel more comfortable being groomed in their own home environment—away from the stress of car rides, carriers, and unfamiliar settings—which is why mobile grooming has become our most popular option.</p>
                    <p>Unlike dog groomers who occasionally work with cats, I focus <strong>100% on feline clients</strong>. This means no barking dogs, no competing smells, and no rushed appointments. Every cat receives my full attention using specialized cat grooming tools and techniques. Whether your cat needs routine maintenance, help with matting, a stylish lion cut, or just a professional nail trim, you can trust that they're in experienced hands.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! While cats do lick themselves, they don't actually "groom" themselves. Licking spreads dander and causes them to ingest loose hair (leading to hairballs). A cat's tongue cannot prevent mats, reduce shedding, trim nails, or clean ears. Professional grooming keeps your cat healthy, comfortable, and reduces allergens in your home.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most cats benefit from professional grooming every 4-8 weeks. Long-haired breeds like Persians and Maine Coons may need grooming every 4-6 weeks, while short-haired cats can go 6-8 weeks between appointments. Regular grooming prevents matting, reduces shedding, and keeps your cat comfortable.</p>

Many cats actually find the warm water and gentle handling relaxing. The key is using proper cat-specific techniques, maintaining a calm environment, and introducing the bathing process gradually. Most of my clients report their cats are calm and content during grooming.</p>

                        <p>Matting occurs when loose, shedding hair combines with natural skin oils and tangles together. Once a small mat forms, it grows quickly and can become painful for your cat. Mats under the armpits cause pain when walking, and mats close to the skin trap moisture leading to skin irritation. Regular professional grooming is the best defense against matting.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A lion cut involves shaving the body while leaving fur on the head (like a mane), legs, and tail tip. It's ideal for cats with severe matting that can't be brushed out, long-haired cats in hot weather, cats who struggle with self-grooming due to age or weight, or cats whose owners want to reduce shedding and maintenance between grooms.</p>

                        <p>Mobile grooming eliminates the stress of car rides and carriers for your cat. Your cat stays in their familiar home environment, which keeps them calmer throughout the grooming process. There's also no exposure to other animals, no waiting in cages, and no risk of picking up illnesses from a shared facility. It's the most stress-free option for most cats.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! We offer standalone nail trim appointments for cats who don't need a full groom. In-studio nail trims start at $25 for the first cat, with additional cats at $10 each. Mobile nail trims start at $40 for the first cat. This is a quick service that most cats tolerate well, and regular nail trims help prevent scratching damage and ingrown nails.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I work with cats of all temperaments. As a CFMG certified groomer, I'm trained in cat behavior and safe handling techniques specifically designed for anxious or defensive cats. I take a patient, gentle approach, allowing breaks when needed and never forcing your cat into stressful situations. Mobile grooming in your cat's home environment often helps anxious cats feel more comfortable.</p>

                        <p>Before your appointment, don't feed your cat for 2-3 hours to prevent nausea. Have your cat's vaccination records ready if requested. For mobile appointments, please have a clear, well-lit area set up near a water source. Keep other pets in a separate room to minimize distractions. Let me know about any health conditions, sensitivities, or behavioral concerns ahead of time.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Professional cat grooming doesn't have to be stressful when done correctly by a trained feline groomer. I use gentle handling techniques specifically designed for cats, work at your cat's pace, and provide a calm, quiet environment without barking dogs or other stressors. Many cats actually relax during grooming once they realize it's a positive experience. Mobile grooming reduces stress further by keeping cats in their familiar home environment.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No, I do not sedate cats for grooming. As a professional cat groomer, I rely on proper handling techniques, patience, and a calm approach to work with all temperaments safely. Sedation carries health risks and should only be administered by a veterinarian for medical procedures. If your cat has extreme anxiety, we can discuss options including shorter sessions or veterinary grooming under sedation.</p>

                        <p>Yes, you're welcome to stay for mobile appointments since they're in your home. However, many cats actually behave better when their owners aren't in the immediate area—cats can pick up on owner anxiety. I'm happy to discuss what works best for your specific cat. You can always check in during the appointment or stay nearby for reassurance.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely! I specialize in grooming all cat breeds, including long-haired breeds like Persians, Himalayans, Maine Coons, and Ragdolls. These breeds require more frequent grooming to prevent matting—typically every 4-6 weeks. I'm experienced with breed-specific needs like Persian face folds and flat-faced breeds that need extra attention around the eyes and nose.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I regularly groom senior cats and understand their unique needs. Older cats may have arthritis, thinner skin, or less patience, so I adjust my techniques accordingly. Senior cats often benefit greatly from professional grooming since they may struggle to groom themselves due to reduced flexibility or weight issues. I take extra care with positioning and work at a slower pace for their comfort.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A lion cut shaves the body very short while leaving a "mane" around the head and a pom on the tail tip—creating a lion-like appearance. A teddy bear cut (or comb cut) trims the entire coat to an even, plush length all over, giving a soft, rounded appearance. The teddy bear cut requires more maintenance than a lion cut but leaves more coat for cats who don't tolerate short clips.</p>
