A cat's tongue cannot prevent mats, reduce shedding, trim nails, or clean ears. Professional grooming keeps your cat healthy, comfortable, and reduces allergens in your home."

Once a small mat forms, it grows quickly and can become painful for your cat. Mats under the armpits cause pain when walking, and mats close to the skin trap moisture leading to skin irritation. Regular professional grooming is the best defense against matting."

Your cat stays in their familiar home environment, which keeps them calmer throughout the grooming process. There's also no exposure to other animals, no waiting in cages, and no risk of picking up illnesses from a shared facility."

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! While cats do lick themselves, they don't actually "groom" themselves. Licking spreads dander and causes them to ingest loose hair (leading to hairballs). A cat's tongue cannot prevent mats, reduce shedding, trim nails, or clean ears. Professional grooming keeps your cat healthy, comfortable, and reduces allergens in your home.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most cats benefit from professional grooming every 4-8 weeks. Long-haired breeds like Persians and Maine Coons may need grooming every 4-6 weeks, while short-haired cats can go 6-8 weeks between appointments. Regular grooming prevents matting, reduces shedding, and keeps your cat comfortable.</p>

                        <p>A CFMG certification is the highest level of professional cat grooming credential, awarded by the National Cat Groomers Institute of America. It requires extensive training, written exams, and practical assessments.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Contrary to popular belief, most cats don't mind being bathed when it's done properly by a trained professional. Many cats actually find the warm water and gentle handling relaxing. The key is using proper cat-specific techniques, maintaining a calm environment, and introducing the bathing process gradually. Most of my clients report their cats are calm and content during grooming.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Matting occurs when loose, shedding hair combines with natural skin oils and tangles together. Once a small mat forms, it grows quickly and can become painful for your cat. Mats under the armpits cause pain when walking, and mats close to the skin trap moisture leading to skin irritation. Regular professional grooming is the best defense against matting.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A lion cut involves shaving the body while leaving fur on the head (like a mane), legs, and tail tip. It's ideal for cats with severe matting that can't be brushed out, long-haired cats in hot weather, cats who struggle with self-grooming due to age or weight, or cats whose owners want to reduce shedding and maintenance between grooms.</p>

                        <span>Why choose mobile grooming over a salon?</span>
                        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Mobile grooming eliminates the stress of car rides and carriers for your cat. Your cat stays in their familiar home environment, which keeps them calmer throughout the grooming process. There's also no exposure to other animals, no waiting in cages, and no risk of picking up illnesses from a shared facility. It's the most stress-free option for most cats.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A standard groom typically takes 1-2 hours depending on your cat's coat condition, temperament, and the services needed. First appointments may take longer as I get to know your cat and let them adjust to the process. I never rush—your cat's comfort and safety always come first.</p>
