## About This Business

Mrs. Tomei Grooms Cats is a professional cat grooming service operated by a Certified Feline Master Groomer (CFMG) in Toronto and Windsor, Ontario. We specialize exclusively in feline grooming, providing gentle, stress-free experiences for cats in a dog-free environment. The CFMG certification represents the highest level of achievement in feline grooming, awarded by the National Cat Groomers Institute of America after rigorous training, written exams, and practical assessments.

Unlike dog groomers who occasionally work with cats, Mrs. Tomei focuses 100% on feline clients. This means specialized cat grooming techniques, cat-specific tools, and a calm environment designed for your cat's comfort. Whether your cat needs routine maintenance grooming, help with matting, a stylish lion cut, or just a professional nail trim, you can trust that they're in experienced hands.

We understand that many cats find traditional grooming salons stressful due to car rides, carriers, and unfamiliar settings. That's why we offer mobile cat grooming house calls—bringing professional grooming directly to your home where your cat feels most comfortable.

## Services Offered

### Standard Cat Groom ($50-$85)
Our signature cat grooming service includes thorough brushing, de-shedding, nail trim, ear cleaning, sanitary trim, and paw pad cleaning. This maintenance service keeps your cat comfortable, reduces shedding around your home, and prevents common issues like matting and ingrown nails. Recommended every 4-8 weeks for optimal feline health.

### Lion Cut ($75+)
A popular cat grooming style that involves shaving the body while leaving fur on the head (like a mane), legs, and tail tip. Ideal for cats with severe matting, long-haired breeds in hot weather, senior cats who struggle with self-grooming, or owners looking to reduce shedding between grooms. The lion cut is our most requested style for Persian cats, Maine Coons, and Ragdolls.

### Comb Cut / Teddy Bear Cut ($70+)
An even trim all over the body for a plush, soft, rounded appearance. The teddy bear cut maintains more coat than a lion cut while still reducing maintenance. Great for cats who don't tolerate very short clips but need coat management.

### Cat Nail Trim ($25-$40)
Professional nail trimming service available as a standalone appointment. Regular nail trims prevent scratching damage to furniture and skin, and help avoid painful ingrown nails. In-studio: $25+. Mobile: $40+. Additional cats: $10 each.

### Soft Paws / Nail Caps ($60+)
Application of soft nail caps that cover your cat's claws to prevent scratching damage while allowing normal nail retraction and extension. Safe and humane alternative to declawing.

### Bath & Blow Dry ($60+)
Deep cleaning with cat-safe, gentle shampoo, thorough rinse, and professional blow dry for a fresh, fluffy coat. Many cats actually find the warm water and gentle handling relaxing when done by a trained professional.

### Add-On Services ($8-$25)
- Paw pad trim
- Belly trim
- De-matting
- Sanitary trim
- Ear cleaning
